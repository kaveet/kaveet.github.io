# MT8766 Processor Disclaimer

## Important: This Guide Does Not Support MT8766 Devices

This documentation is written specifically for Qin F21 Pro devices with the **MediaTek Helio A22 (MT6761)** processor.

**If your device has the MT8766 processor, this guide may not work and could potentially brick your device.**

## How to Check Your Processor

You can verify your processor model by:

1. Installing CPU-Z or a similar system information app
2. Checking the "SoC" or "Chipset" information
3. Looking for either "MT6761" (supported) or "MT8766" (not supported)

## Why This Matters

The MT8766 variant has:

- Different bootloader unlocking procedures
- Different partition layouts
- Incompatible firmware and recovery images
- Different rooting requirements

**Attempting to follow MT6761 guides on an MT8766 device can result in a bricked phone.**
