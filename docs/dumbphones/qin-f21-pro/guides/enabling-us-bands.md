# Enabling US Bands

{{ mt8766_warning_subdir }}

*This guide is under construction.*

The Qin F21 Pro can be modified to support additional US cellular bands by flashing modem files from the Qin F30 (the US-market variant). This modification enables support for crucial US carrier bands including B12, B13, B66, and B71.

## Prerequisites

- Unlocked bootloader
- TWRP recovery installed
- Backup of your current modem/baseband

## Overview

After modification, the F21 Pro can support the following LTE bands:

**LTE Bands**: B2, B4, B12, B13, B17, B66, B71

This significantly improves compatibility with US carriers, particularly:
- T-Mobile and T-Mobile MVNOs (Mint Mobile, US Mobile)
- AT&T (limited improvement)
- Verizon (requires CDMA-less mode activation)

## Important Caveats

Some users report that while the phone will display these bands as available in engineering mode after modification, the actual hardware may not fully utilize all bands as effectively as a native F30 device. Real-world signal performance may vary by location and carrier.
