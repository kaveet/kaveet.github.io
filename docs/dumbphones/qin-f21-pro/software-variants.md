# Software Variants

The Qin F21 Pro is available with several different software configurations. This guide breaks down the major software variants, common seller terminology, and important considerations around privacy and functionality.

## Overview of Main Software Variants

The F21 Pro ecosystem includes three primary reseller configurations and a number of community-developed alternatives.

### Stock Chinese ROM (Factory Original)

The original factory ROM ships with Chinese and English language support, a locked bootloader, and no Google Play services. This is the most common "out of the box" configuration for phones purchased directly from Chinese retailers without modifications.

**What to expect:**

- Chinese applications pre-installed (various Xiaomi/MIUI/Duoqin apps, Chinese app stores)
- Bootloader is locked by default
- No Google Play Store or Google services
- APK installation may be restricted or limited
- Two-language support (Chinese/English) with some menus remaining in Chinese
- Contains bloatware and may "phone home" to Chinese servers
- Requires unlocking and modification to be useful for most Western users.

### "Cracked" or "Hacked" Versions with Google Play

These modified versions have become extremely popular on marketplaces like AliExpress and through various resellers. A third party has unlocked the bootloader, installed Google Play Store and services, and sometimes debloated the ROM to varying degrees.

**What to expect:**

- Bootloader is unlocked (or partially unlocked)
- Google Play Store and Google Play Services pre-installed
- ROM claims to be "Google certified" (though this is often questionable)
- Varying levels of Chinese app removal
- May include root access (Magisk) pre-installed
- Unknown modifications to system files
- Inconsistent quality depending on who modified the device

**Important privacy consideration:** These ROMs are modified by unknown third parties. You have no guarantee about what has been added, removed, or modified in the system. While many users report positive experiences, the security and privacy implications of running unknown modified firmware should be carefully considered.

### International/Global/Multilanguage ROMs

Sometimes listed as "Global Version" or "Multilanguage Version," these ROMs support more languages beyond just Chinese and English. They typically include Google Play but are **not Google certified**.

**What to expect:**

- Support for multiple languages (French, Russian, Spanish, and others depending on version)
- Bootloader unlocked
- Google Play Store present but **not certified**
- Banking apps, payment apps, and some security-focused apps may not work due to lack of certification
- Often reduced bloatware compared to stock Chinese ROM
- Better suited for international use but with certification limitations

The lack of Google certification is a critical limitation. Many banking apps, authenticator apps, and apps with stringent security requirements check for Play Protect certification and will refuse to run on uncertified devices.

## Kosher/Filtered Versions

Several vendors in the Orthodox Jewish community offer specially modified versions of the F21 Pro with filtering and restrictions built into the operating system. These are sold under various brand names and are fundamentally different from other variants.

**Common kosher software providers:**

- KosherQinOS (by Kosher Qin Phone)
- K-mobile Kosher Software
- Kosher Electronics filtered OS
- Various Israeli modders producing custom Kosher ROMs

**What to expect:**

- Locked-down operating system with no user access to install/remove apps
- Built-in content filtering at the system level
- Curated app stores with pre-approved applications only
- No web browser or unrestricted internet access
- Different tier levels (Basic, Advanced, Premium) with different app bundles
- Cannot be modified or unlocked without specialized knowledge
- Significantly more expensive than standard variants

These versions are purpose-built for users who want smartphone capabilities (GPS, ride-sharing apps, messaging) without unrestricted internet access. They represent a completely different use case from standard Android configurations.

## Community-Developed Custom ROMs

The community has developed several custom ROM options, though support and development vary.

### Custom Debloated ROMs (4PDA/XDA Community)

Community members, particularly from the Russian 4PDA forums and XDA Developers, have created custom firmware based on the stock ROM with improvements:

**Features:**

- Version 1.1.1 multilanguage firmware (most popular community ROM)
- Chinese applications removed
- Decrypted data partition
- APK installer with no restrictions
- System partitions made writable
- TWRP recovery 3.6.0 included
- Compatible with Magisk and custom Google Apps packages

**Important notes:**

- Primarily designed for the 4GB/64GB variant
- **NOT recommended for 3GB/32GB variants** (reports of bricking)
- Requires unlocked bootloader
- Full device wipe during installation
- Community support available but limited
- Quality varies; some users report excellent results, others encounter bugs

### GSI (Generic System Image) ROMs

Some advanced users have experimented with GSI ROMs like LineageOS 18.1 and other AOSP-based systems. Development is ongoing but limited.

**What to expect:**

- Requires significant technical knowledge
- Many device-specific features may not work correctly
- Keyboard functionality often requires remapping
- Google certification issues
- Active development in some community spaces
- Best suited for advanced users willing to troubleshoot

The GSI approach remains experimental for the F21 Pro, and most users are better served by stock or community-modified ROMs.

## Understanding Seller Terminology on AliExpress

When purchasing from AliExpress, sellers use various terms that can be confusing. Here's how to decode the common monikers:

### "Cracked Version"
Indicates the bootloader has been unlocked and Google Play has been installed. This is often what most Western buyers want, but quality varies significantly between sellers.

### "Unlocked Version"
Ambiguous—could mean carrier-unlocked, bootloader-unlocked, or both. Usually refers to bootloader unlocked with ability to install APKs, but **may not include Google Play**. Always verify with the seller.

### "Global Version" or "Global ROM"
Usually means multilanguage support and Google Play included, but not Google certified. Sometimes used interchangeably with "International Version."

### "Google Play Version" or "GApps Version"
Google Play Store is pre-installed. May or may not be Google certified—ask specifically about certification if you need banking/payment apps.

### "Google Certified" or "Play Certified"
Sellers claim the device passes Google Play Protect certification. **Treat this claim with skepticism**—many devices claiming certification actually fail the check. You can verify yourself after receiving the device.

### "Root Version" or "Magisk Version"
Device comes with root access (usually Magisk) pre-installed. Useful for advanced modifications but incompatible with many banking and security apps.

### "Original Factory" or "CN Version"
Stock Chinese ROM with locked bootloader and no Google services. Usually the cheapest option but requires significant modification to be useful.

## Privacy, Security, and "Phoning Home" Concerns

One of the most important considerations with any Chinese smartphone is data privacy. The F21 Pro has documented privacy concerns that potential buyers should understand.

### Known Data Collection

Community research using tools like PCAPdroid has identified that stock ROMs send data to various Chinese servers:

**Documented connections:**
- duoqin.com (manufacturer servers)
- miui.com (Xiaomi services)
- Chinese NTP (time) servers
- Various analytics and telemetry services

The exact nature of this data collection varies by ROM version, but the community consensus is that **stock factory ROMs should not be trusted for privacy-sensitive use**.

### Evaluating Different ROM Variants

**Stock Chinese ROM:** Highest privacy risk. Known to send data to Chinese servers. Contains bloatware with unclear data collection practices.

**"Cracked" versions from unknown sellers:** Unknown risk. You don't know what modifications were made or what might have been added. Could be more private than stock (bloatware removed) or less private (additional tracking added).

**Community-developed ROMs:** Generally considered safer than stock or unknown "cracked" versions because the community can examine and discuss the modifications. However, still based on potentially compromised stock firmware.

**Kosher versions:** Privacy implications vary by provider. Some collect minimal data, others may have telemetry. Usually focused on content filtering rather than data collection.

### Recommendations for Privacy-Conscious Users

If privacy is a concern, consider these approaches:

1. **Flash a known community ROM** after purchase to remove unknown modifications and Chinese bloatware
2. **Use root access and firewall apps** to monitor and block suspicious network traffic
3. **Consider a custom GSI ROM** like LineageOS if you have technical expertise, though functionality trade-offs exist
4. **Use a VPN** to obscure your network traffic from the device
5. **Debloat thoroughly** using tools like Universal Android Debloater to remove telemetry apps
6. **Accept the limitations** and avoid storing sensitive information on the device

### Setting Proper Expectations

**For Google Play versions:**

- Many users report that pre-installed Google Play works fine for basic apps
- Banking apps and payment apps frequently fail due to lack of proper certification
- Google Pay and similar services often don't work
- You can manually install many apps via APK even if Google Play has issues
- Safety Net/Play Integrity checks often fail

**For Chinese ROMs:**

- Assume data collection is happening
- Difficult to fully remove all telemetry without flashing a new ROM
- Some Chinese apps may be deeply integrated and difficult to remove
- Language support may be incomplete even on "multilanguage" versions

## Summary Table: Software Variant Comparison

| Variant | Bootloader | Google Play | Certified | Privacy Risk | Best For |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| Stock Chinese | Locked | No | N/A | High | Advanced users who will flash custom ROM |
| "Cracked"/Hacked | Unlocked | Yes | Maybe | Unknown | General use, accepting unknowns |
| International/Global | Unlocked | Yes | No | Medium-High | Users who don't need banking apps |
| Kosher Modified | Locked | No | N/A | Low-Medium | Users wanting filtered/restricted device |
| Community Custom | Unlocked | Optional | No | Medium | Users comfortable with flashing/modding |
| GSI/LineageOS | Unlocked | Optional | No | Low-Medium | Advanced users, experimental |

## Which Version Should You Choose?

Your choice depends on your priorities:

**Choose stock Chinese ROM if:** You plan to flash a custom ROM yourself and want the cheapest option.

**Choose "cracked"/hacked version if:** You want Google Play working out of the box and accept unknown third-party modifications.

**Choose international/global if:** You need multilanguage support and don't rely on banking/payment apps.

**Choose kosher version if:** You specifically want a filtered, restricted device for religious or digital minimalism purposes.

**Choose to flash custom ROM yourself if:** You have technical skills, prioritize privacy, and want full control over your device.

Remember that the F21 Pro community primarily congregates on XDA Developers forums, Reddit's r/dumbphones, and various Telegram groups where you can get real-time advice about specific versions and sellers.
