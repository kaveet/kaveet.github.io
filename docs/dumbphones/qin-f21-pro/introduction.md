# About the Qin F21 Pro

## Overview

The Qin F21 Pro offers full smartphone capabilities in a feature phone form factor. The device runs Android 11 on the MediaTek Helio A22 (`mtk6761`) processor. It combines a 2.8-inch touchscreen and a physical T9-style keypad.

### Original Market Positioning

In China, the F21 Pro was designed as an affordable communication device for students. The compact size, basic cameras, and restricted app installation aligned with preferences for distraction-free devices. Internationally, this positioning has been overtaken by its reputation as a minimalist smartphone alternative (affectionately, a "smart dumbphone").

### Xiaomi and Duoqin

Despite "Xiaomi Qin F21 Pro" branding by some sellers, the device is manufactured by Shenzhen Duoqin Technology Co., Ltd. Duoqin operates within Xiaomi's ecosystem but maintains independence in product development and distribution.

### Qin F30

The F21 Pro is closely related to the Qin F30, which includes native support for US cellular bands (particularly T-Mobile). Community members have developed methods to enable similar band support on the F21 Pro by porting F30 baseband configurations. See the US band enabling guide for details.
